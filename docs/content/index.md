# GogApi.Dotnet

This project aims at providing an interface to use the (unofficial) GOG API from .NET.
At the moment the focus lies on F#.

Like the README states it uses the knowledge from
<https://www.gog.com/forum/general/unofficial_gog_api_documentation/page1> | 
<https://gogapidocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> but
I don't rule out the possibility to further extend this (and hopefully contribute
it to linked documentation) by own investigations.
